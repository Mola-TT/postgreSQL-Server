# PostgreSQL Server Initialization Core Rules

## Project Purpose
This project contains Ubuntu scripts for initializing a PostgreSQL server. The scripts are developed on a Windows machine but deployed on Ubuntu systems.

## Core Development Rules

### Code Principles
- **Minimal Code** ‚Äì No unnecessary functions, variables, or complexity
- **Direct Implementation** ‚Äì Solve problems using the shortest and clearest approach
- **Line Endings** ‚Äì Be mindful of Windows vs Ubuntu newline character differences
- **Single Source of Truth** ‚Äì All configuration and setup logic in main initialization scripts
- **NO HOTFIXES** ‚Äì All fixes must be implemented directly in the main scripts

### ‚ùå What NOT to Do
- **NEVER create separate hotfix scripts**  
  - Avoid patching issues with temporary fixes
  - Keep the initialization script as the single source of truth
  - Do not create workarounds outside the main scripts
  - Do not implement temporary solutions with the intention to "fix properly later"

### ‚úÖ What to Do Instead
1. **Fix initialization scripts directly**  
   - Identify and correct issues in the main scripts
   - Ensure fixes integrate smoothly into the existing setup process
   - All fixes must be permanent solutions implemented in the original scripts
   - Document any significant changes within the script comments

### üéØ Project Goals
- Maintain a **clean and maintainable** setup process
- Ensure **consistent deployments** without scattered fixes
- Keep scripts **self-sufficient and reliable**
- **Zero tolerance** for temporary hotfixes or workarounds

### Development Workflow
1. Identify issues or improvements needed
2. Modify main script files directly - NEVER create separate fix scripts
3. Test changes thoroughly on Windows
4. Ensure line endings are properly handled for Ubuntu deployment
5. Generate code according to the current milestone stated in `001.milestone.mdc` and minimize modifications that affect other milestones
