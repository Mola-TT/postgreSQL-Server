# Milestone

## Current Progress: Milestone 2

## Milestone 2
- Created `postgresql_config.sh` under setup folder that:
  - Installs PostgreSQL using the official repository
  - Installs pgbouncer for connection pooling
  - Configures PostgreSQL with proper security settings:
    - Uses secure scram-sha-256 authentication instead of md5
    - Restricts direct PostgreSQL access to local connections only
    - Routes all external connections through pgbouncer
    - Configures firewall to enforce this connection policy
  - Sets up pgbouncer as middleware:
    - Uses a simplified, reliable configuration approach
    - Implements robust configuration verification without error messages
    - Includes automatic fallback to simpler configuration if needed
    - Features multiple verification methods for password hash extraction
  - Creates user-specified database
  - Configures client authentication based on user-defined IP ranges
  - Sets and secures PostgreSQL superuser password
  - Uses environment variables for all configuration settings
- Updated `init.sh` to include PostgreSQL installation and configuration
- Enhanced environment configuration:
  - Added PostgreSQL-specific settings to default.env and user.env.template
  - Added pgbouncer configuration settings
  - Added PostgreSQL superuser password management
- Improved logging and error handling:
  - Ensured clean, error-free logs during normal operation
  - Implemented graceful fallback mechanisms for configuration issues
  - Added verification steps for all critical components

## Milestone 1

1. Created an `init.sh` script that:
   - Updates the Ubuntu server silently
   - Sets up timezone directly from configuration
   - Checks if running as root
   - Loads environment variables
   - Provides proper initialization flow

2. Created a `logger.sh` script with logging functions:
   - Implemented color-coded log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
   - Made log message timestamps bold
   - Made log messages white by default
   - Applied colors only to log level text
   - Added file logging capability

3. Created environment configuration:
   - Added `default.env` with default configuration
   - Added `user.env.template` for user-specific settings
   - Implemented environment variable override logic

4. Added utility functions:
   - Created `utilities.sh` with helper functions
   - Implemented `execute_silently` for quiet command execution
   - Added log file management

5. Created general configuration:
   - Added system update functionality
   - Added timezone configuration

## Original Objectives

1. Create an `init.sh` script to update the Ubuntu server silently
2. Create a `logger.sh` script to provide a logging function
   - Log messages should be white in color by default
   - Timestamps in logs should be bold
   - Only log level text and log level should have color formatting
3. Create a `user.env` file for entering user variables
4. Create a `default.env` file for default variables
